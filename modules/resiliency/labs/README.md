# Labs

## Lab 1: Implementing Circuit Breaker Pattern with Resilience4j
**Objective:** Set up a Circuit Breaker to handle service failures gracefully in a Spring Boot application using Resilience4j.

**Instructions:**
- Create a Spring Boot application that integrates Resilience4j by adding the `resilience4j-spring-boot3` dependency.
- Implement a RESTful service that simulates a delay or failure (e.g., throwing an exception) when a certain endpoint is hit.
- Apply the Circuit Breaker pattern to the service to prevent cascading failures when the service is down.
- Test the Circuit Breaker by repeatedly calling the endpoint and observing the behavior during failure and recovery.

## Lab 2: Implementing Retry Mechanism
**Objective:** Set up a retry mechanism to automatically retry failed requests in a Spring Boot application.

**Instructions:**
- Extend the Spring Boot application from Lab 1 to include a retry mechanism using Resilience4j's Retry feature.
- Configure the retry behavior (e.g., number of attempts, wait duration) for the RESTful service endpoint.
- Test the retry mechanism by simulating transient failures and ensuring that the application retries the request as configured.

## Lab 3: Bulkhead Pattern for Resource Isolation
**Objective:** Implement the Bulkhead pattern to isolate resources in a Spring Boot application using Resilience4j.

**Instructions:**
- Create a new Spring Boot service that simulates resource-intensive operations (e.g., long-running tasks).
- Use Resilience4j to implement the Bulkhead pattern, isolating resources for different parts of the application (e.g., separating HTTP calls from database calls).
- Test the Bulkhead pattern by simulating high load on one part of the application and verifying that it does not affect the other parts.
